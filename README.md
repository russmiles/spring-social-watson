## Obtaining IBM Watson Developer Cloud API Credentials
 
You will need to obtain separate service credentials for each of the IBM Watson Developer Cloud APIs to run the examples in this codebase. This shouldn't take longer than a few moments and can be achieved by following these instructions:
 
* [Instructions for getting credentials for IBM Watson Services through IBM Bluemix](https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/getting_started/gs-credentials.shtml)

## To execute 'Smoke Test' status checked against the IBM Watson services

It's a little bit of a hack but there is a way of inspecting the current status of the hosted IBM Watson services. We've added this to a collection of tests that can be run using:

 ./gradlew smokeTest
